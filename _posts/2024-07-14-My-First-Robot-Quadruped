## My First Robot 

in August 23rd 2021 I made my first robot a quadruped using this tutorial https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:38159. I downloaded the STL file and then brought the required 9g servo motors Arduino circuit board ect.

During the creation of my first quadruped I had a lot of things go wrong the stride as seen in this video https://imgur.com/gallery/C8f8fTd and the legs broke themselves by not having the servos properly screwed in and the force being too much that they snapped. I "cleverly" fixed my mistakes by using a glue gun and glueing it all back together... probably not the best decision but it did work, I should have really just re printed the parts. The stride was fixed with the code itself I managed to edit so that it could walk by itself which can be seen in this video https://imgur.com/gallery/lJw4lnu
