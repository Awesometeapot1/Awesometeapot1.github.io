## A Robotic Arm

On the 20th of November 2021 I made a robotic arm with 9g servos and 3d printed parts, I've unfortunately lost the tutorial I used on thingiverse for this so I can't link it unfortunately.

I didn't have a lot of problems with this in all honesty except the claw at the end I printed multiple times but couldn't attach it. I eventually want to put all the parts together in a box which can hold them so they are more organised as it's a bit of a mess....but it does work.
