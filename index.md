This is a website I plan to blog about projects I have done in the past and are ongoing 

I'm an autistic Lesbian who is 21 years old and I'm really into robots.

My coding experience is pretty weak I have done a year of coding in college and will be starting a computer science degree at university on September 2024

the languages that I know are C++,C#, html, CSS and python
